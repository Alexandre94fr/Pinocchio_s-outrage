# Pinocchio's outrage

## ➤ Context of the game's creation :
- This "game" is a study project at La Horde were I had to create a "game" in 5 weeks (less than 84 hours of pure work in reality {without courses, and with schedule changes}), I was the only student programmers working on this project, all the documents who were created in the process are in the [Documents folder](https://github.com/Alexandre94fr/Pinocchio_s-outrage/tree/main/Documents).

- If I choose to put quotes around the word "game" it's because it's absolutly not finished, not even at the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. Plus, I would like to add that I prefer to work in depth, by that I mean that I prefer take more time for each feature or things to do. This extra time is spent to know and understand the possible best ways to make what I want to do. This strategy has two major consequences :
  - Knowing deeper things in specific subject
  - Knowing less things in general (because I never work on them for now)

_*does the action do completely what is supposed to do._

**Note :** The "Interact with interactable" action will spawn one new character, it's for debug purpose, but you can have it :)
